## Getting Started

*This template does not work on its own*. It is missing the Ionic library, and AngularJS.

### With the Ionic tool:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
```

Then, to run it:

```bash
$ ionic platform add ios
$ ionic build ios
$ ionic emulate ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac, but if you can, the ios development toolchain is a lot easier to work with until you need to do anything custom to Android.
